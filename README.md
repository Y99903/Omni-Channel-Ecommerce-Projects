\f0\b\fs36 \cf0 \ul \ulc0 Project Description
\f1\b0\fs24 \ulnone \
\
The Omnichannel Retail Analytics Project is a simulation of a modern retail business that sells products across multiple channels \'97 both online (e-commerce) and offline (physical stores). The purpose of this project is to design and implement a realistic retail database system in MySQL, perform business-driven queries, and create Tableau dashboards for actionable insights.\
\

\f0\b \ul -> This project mimics how real retail companies manage and analyze their sales data:
\f1\b0 \ulnone \
\

\f0\b \ul Data Modeling 
\f2\b0 \ulnone \uc0\u8594 
\f1  A complete retail schema with Customers, Products, Stores, Staff, Sales, and Sale Items.\
\

\f0\b \ul Data Management 
\f2\b0 \ulnone \uc0\u8594 
\f1  Sample data insertions to simulate transactions across different channels.\
\

\f0\b \ul Data Analytics
\f1\b0 \ulnone  
\f2 \uc0\u8594 
\f1  SQL queries for analyzing total sales, profit, monthly trends, product performance, store efficiency, and customer behavior.\
\

\f0\b \ul Business Intelligence
\f1\b0 \ulnone  
\f2 \uc0\u8594 
\f1  Tableau dashboards that transform raw data into clear visual insights.\
\
\

\f0\b \ul -> By working on this project, one can:
\f1\b0 \ulnone \
\
Understand how omnichannel businesses integrate data from online and offline transactions.\
\

Build interactive dashboards that help business stakeholders track KPIs (Key Performance Indicators).\
\
Gain hands-on experience with the end-to-end analytics workflow: from database creation 
\f2 \uc0\u8594 
\f1  data insertion 
\f2 \uc0\u8594 
\f1  querying 
\f2 \uc0\u8594 
\f1  visualization.\
\
\

\f0\b \ul -> In short, this project demonstrates how SQL + Tableau can be combined to answer key retail business questions like:
\f1\b0 \ulnone \
