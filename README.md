Project Description

The Omnichannel Retail Analytics Project is a simulation of a modern retail business that sells products across multiple channels — both online (e-commerce) and offline (physical stores). The purpose of this project is to design and implement a realistic retail database system in MySQL, perform business-driven queries, and create Tableau dashboards for actionable insights.

-> This project mimics how real retail companies manage and analyze their sales data:

Data Modeling → A complete retail schema with Customers, Products, Stores, Staff, Sales, and Sale Items.

Data Management → Sample data insertions to simulate transactions across different channels.

Data Analytics → SQL queries for analyzing total sales, profit, monthly trends, product performance, store efficiency, and customer behavior.

Business Intelligence → Tableau dashboards that transform raw data into clear visual insights.


-> By working on this project, one can:

Understand how omnichannel businesses integrate data from online and offline transactions.

Learn SQL for real-world analytics use cases such as sales tracking, trend analysis, customer insights, and inventory monitoring.

Build interactive dashboards that help business stakeholders track KPIs (Key Performance Indicators).

Gain hands-on experience with the end-to-end analytics workflow: from database creation → data insertion → querying → visualization.


-> In short, this project demonstrates how SQL + Tableau can be combined to answer key retail business questions like:

📊 What is the total sales and profit over time?

🛍 Which products generate the highest revenue?

🏬 Which store performs the best in terms of sales?

👥 How do customer purchases vary across online vs. in-store channels?
